File description

0.1 main.py = main script which load and test a single trainable model (it contains sklearn library only for running Support Vector Machine, SVM)
        --> To run Decision Trees change the line 20 as 
                    "algorithm = WhichAlgorithm.DCT"
        --> To run Random forest change the line 20 as 
                    "algorithm = WhichAlgorithm.RFT"
        --> To run Support Vector Machine change the line 20 as 
                    "algorithm = WhichAlgorithm.SVM"
        --> To run K-nearest neighbors change the line 20 as 
                    "algorithm = WhichAlgorithm.KNN"
                    **(KMean_enbled is used to turn on K-mean clustering or not)
                   
0.2 model_search_main.py = it is used to generate multiple testing with different hyperparmeters 
        --> Multiple testing cases are generated by the class called "param_set" which is built in utils.py 

0.3 utils.py = it contains the set of hyperparmeters for testing, and also contains useful common functions. 

1. decision_tree.py = implementation of Decition Trees
2. random_forest.py = implementation of Random forest 
3. knn.py = implementation of k nearest neighboring classification & k means clustering
